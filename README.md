# Tims-Book-Alchemy
This is the Codio-Project from Tim havind the functionality of adding a book, deleting a book...also the author if not 
anymore present, sorting the books by title or by author, adding an author
It consist of 2 Python-Programs like app.py and data_models.py
In folder templates you find home.html, add_author.html and add_book.html
The database is inside the folder data and is named library.sqlite
There are already about 10 books with phantasy title, isbn, publication_year and author inside.
The project is running on my MAc-Airbook from Masterschool on localhost 127.0.0.1:5000. It is started
by my standart IDE PYCharm, having flask, flask_sqlalcheny, sqlalchemy, os and others installed.
The unique first run of app.py needs to get the tables inside the database file created..for further running
no need for this. Here I got Error-Messages that makes me using an absolute path...relative was not finding the file.
